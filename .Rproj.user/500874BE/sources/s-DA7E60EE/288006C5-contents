I am a community ecologist and my research is focused on microbial community assembly in the plant microbiome. The motivating theme that underlies my research is the desire to understand how processes operating across broad spatial and temporal scales can help explain microbial community assembly in the present-day. My use of the plant microbiome as a study system is motivated by two key factors. First, microbial communities have relatively rapid temporal dynamics, allowing them to serve as tractable model systems to address otherwise difficult questions in community ecology. Second, plant microbiome composition can dramatically affect plant productivity and health, and applications of plant microbiome science promise to help combat global food and natural resource insecurity.

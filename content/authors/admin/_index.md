I am an ecologist with a passion for microbial community ecology, molecular ecology, and bioinformatics. The motivating theme that underlies my personal research is the desire to understand how processes operating across broad spatial and temporal scales can help explain microbial community assembly in the present-day. My use of the plant microbiome as a study system is motivated by two key factors. First, microbial communities have relatively rapid temporal dynamics, allowing them to serve as tractable model systems to address otherwise difficult questions in community ecology. Second, plant microbiome composition can dramatically affect plant productivity and health, and applications of plant microbiome science promise to help combat global food and natural resource insecurity.

As a bioinformaticist, I have a passion for data visualization, teaching essential computational skills for biologists, and producing highly efficient, reproducible computational workflows. In addition to having extensive experience with many ecological data analysis techniques (e.g., multivariate analyses, spatial analyses, network analyses, etc.), I have extensive experience developing bioinformatic pipelines for microbiome data processing.
